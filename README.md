# pingPong-scorekeeper
This exercise is part of the Web Development Bootcamp 2021 lectured by professor Colt Steele, and it aims to simulate a table tennis game.
At first, the user should input how many points will be the winning score using pre-defined options within a select.
Then, using event listeners, player1 and player2 will update their respective scores through clicking. When winning score is reached by one of them, the game ends.
